# Hazard-Hallways
This is the second game that I made with Unity 3D. It is a first-person obstacle course game where you have to navigate through various hallways and rooms while avoiding touching any hazards or falling into any pits. I experimented a little with different surface textures and lighting sources in this game and was satisfied with how they gave the levels the "old laboratory" feel.
